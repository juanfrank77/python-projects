# Python for Backend & AI/ML

This repo holds different projects (mostly small and practical) that I've had developed in my journey learning Python from scratch.

If you want to know the 'why' and 'how' of all that learning, check out [this intro to the challenge](https://dev.to/juanfrank77/how-long-would-it-take-you-to-learn-something-new-3go6) and also [the challenge recap](https://dev.to/juanfrank77/python-challenge-recap-g7b).

Here's a list of the current projects:
- A HTTP web server.
- A (very minimal) redis server.
- A multi-class classification model.
- A bigram "name generator" model.
