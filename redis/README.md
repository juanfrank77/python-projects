This is a starting point for a Redis server.

Made for Codecrafters "Build Your Own Redis" challenge.

In the challenge, the idea is to build a toy Redis server that's capable of handling like `PING`, `GET` and `SET`.

To be able to run this:

1. Ensure that you have Python `python 3.11` installed locally.
2. Run the `main.py` file to start the program.
