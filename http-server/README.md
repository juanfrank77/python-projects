This is a sample implementation of an HTTP server.

Made for Codecrafters "Build Your Own HTTP Server" challenge.

[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP) is the protocol that powers the web.
In the challenge, I built a HTTP/1.1 server that is capable of serving multiple clients.

To be able to run this:

1. Ensure that you have Python `python 3.11` installed locally.
2. Run the `main.py` file to start the program.
